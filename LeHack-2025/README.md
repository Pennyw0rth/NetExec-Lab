Welcome to the NetExec Active Directory Lab! This lab is designed to teach you how to exploit Active Directory (AD) environments using the powerful tool NetExec.

Originally featured in the lehack 2025 CTF, this lab is now available for free to everyone! In this lab, you’ll explore how to use the powerful tool NetExec to efficiently compromise an Active Directory domain during an internal pentest.

The ultimate goal? Become Domain Administrator by following various attack paths, using nothing but NetExec! and Maybe BloodHound (Why not?) 

Obviously do not cheat by looking at the passwords and flags in the recipe files, the lab must start without user to full compromise.

> In the vast digital galaxy of Star Wars, strange whispers travel through the networks of both the Empire and the Rebellion. Someone — a spy — is playing both sides. Your mission: dive deep into two interconnected Active Directory environments, follow the trails through users, trusts, and hidden permissions, and unmask the traitor before it’s too late. Use your wits to explore, escalate, and uncover the truth hidden within the galaxy. The fate of the galaxy’s secrets rests in your hands.
