  - [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs)
  - [Vmware utility driver](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads/vmware)

### Install Vmware workstation

- Download and install vmware workstation and set your license key (or use the 30 days trial) [workstation-pro-evaluation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)
- __Note that workstation-player can't manage clone and snapshot and will not work with vagrant you need to use the pro version__
- You will also need to install VMware Utility driver (https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads/vmware)
(an install guide can be found here : https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware/vagrant-vmware-utility)

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant-vmware-utility/1.0.21/vagrant-vmware-utility_1.0.21_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mkdir -p /opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/bin
sudo unzip -d /opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/bin vagrant-vmware-utility_1.0.21_linux_amd64.zip
sudo /opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/bin/vagrant-vmware-utility certificate generate
sudo /opt/vagrant-vmware-desktop/bin/vagrant-vmware-utility service install
```

- Note that you will need to install the vmware-desktop plugin after the vagrant installation : 

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-desktop
```

### Install Vagrant

- **vagrant** from their official site [vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads). __The version you can install through your favorite package manager (apt, yum, ...) is probably not the latest one__.
- Install vagrant plugin vbguest if you want the guest addition: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest` (not mandatory)
- Vagrant installation is well describe in [the official vagrant page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads) (tests are ok on 2.3.4)
- Some github issues indicate vagrant got some issue on some version and work well with 2.2.19 (`apt install vagrant=2.2.19`)

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant
```

- on some recent versions (ubuntu 23.04), you should consider run also:
```bash
gem install winrm winrm-fs winrm-elevated
```

### Install Ansible

- If you want to play ansible from your host or a linux vm you should launch the following commands :

- *Create a python >= 3.8 virtualenv*

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec-Lab
cd BARBHACK-2024/ansible
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
python3.8 -m virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Install ansible and pywinrm in the .venv
  - **ansible** following the extensive guide on their website [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
  - **Tested with ansible-core (2.12)**
  - **pywinrm** be sure you got the pywinrm package installed

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install ansible-core==2.12.6
python3 -m pip install pywinrm
```

- Install all the ansible-galaxy requirements
  - **ansible windows**
  - **ansible community.windows**
  - **ansible chocolatey** (not needed anymore)
  - **ansible community.general**
```
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

## Install

### Create the vms

- To create the VMs just run 

```bash
cd ad/BARBHACK/providers/vmware
vagrant up

*note: For some distributions, you may need to run additional commands to install WinRM gems* this can be done via the following commands:

```bash
vagrant plugin install winrm
vagrant plugin install winrm-fs
vagrant plugin install winrm-elevated
```

- At the end of the vagrantup you should have the vms created and running
### Launch provisioning with Ansible

- launch the provision script (launch ansible with failover on errors)

```bash
cd ansible
export ANSIBLE_COMMAND="ansible-playbook -i ../ad/BARBHACK/data/inventory -i ../ad/BARBHACK/providers/vmware/inventory"
export LAB="BARBHACK"
../scripts/provisionning.sh
```

- or launch ansible directly

```bash
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/BARBHACK/data/inventory -i ../ad/BARBHACK/providers/vmware/inventory main.yml
```
### Once install has finished disable vagrant user to avoid using it

```bash
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/BARBHACK/providers/vmware/inventory_disablevagrant disable_vagrant.yml
```

### Now do a reboot of all the machines to avoid unintended secrets stored / am looking at you Lsassy

```bash
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/BARBHACK/providers/vmware/inventory_disablevagrant reboot.yml
```
